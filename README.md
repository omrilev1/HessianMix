# Iterative_Hessian_Mixing

Supporting code for the iterative Hessian mixing algorithm

For running the simulations, clone the repository and run HessianSketch_main; The datasets are picked internally inside this script. 

For simulating the Slice and the Buzz datasets, extract the .txt files from "slice_train" and "buzz_train" into the "datasets" folder.
